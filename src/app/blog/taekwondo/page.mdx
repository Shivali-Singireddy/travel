I first joined taekwondo as a middle schooler in my hometown. My parents wanted me to have a way to protect myself in case I was in a situation which required me to use these skills. They also wanted me to engage in physical activity since I had gained a lot of weight and only seemed interested in academics. As a middle schooler, I was extremely scarred of sparring and gravitated towards poomsae, which felt like the safer option at the time. I loved learning the techniques and the precision required behind the forms. It almost felt like there was a correct mathematical formula where if I followed all the steps correctly, I would crack the form.

I practiced Taekwondo for 2.5 years until I made it to high school and earned my black belt. When I first earned my black belt, to say I knew sparring would have been laughable. And as a black belt I felt I could no longer attend the sparring practices as a novice, so I didnâ€™t. Coming to MIT Sport Taekwondo felt like the fresh start I needed. 

As I entered high school, I became more aware of my place in the world and how others perceive me. As a smaller female girl, I knew that I appeared as a target, and I wanted to have the ability to defend myself. The first step in that was becoming stronger, so I started lifting weights consistently. I continued this into college, but a small part of me was nagged by the thought that while I was a black belt in martial arts, it was perhaps in name only. I was living under the guise that I could theoretically defend myself, but the practical application of this was questionable. In my heart, I knew that if I wanted confidence in myself, to be able to achieve my dreams of travelling the world without being as scared for my own safety, my skills needed more work.

I was first introduced to MIT Sport Taekwondo my sophomore fall when I joined the Taekwondo PE class. I originally joined because I needed the PE credit and figured it would be nice to relearn some of the concepts and techniques I learned in middle school. I had never intended to stay for 3 years and be a part of the club. However, my PE line leader and future mentor Akila convinced me to stay for the second hour of practice and having that inbuilt friend was the extra support I needed to feel welcomed to practices in the club. While Akila was the one who gave me the initial push to try the club out, it was the instructors who convinced me to stay. 

At the club, I attended my first sparring practice and felt comfortable with starting from the basics without the title of black belt looming over my head. This time, as a taekwondoist, my goal was to overcome my fear of sparring and excel in this area of the martial arts. When I told people I was a black belt, I wanted to actually feel like a black belt. 

My first sparring practice left a lot to be learned. I did not have the same level of cardio as others in the club, and I was not even able to determine simple things like what proper kicking distance was for me. However, these setbacks only served as inspiration for me. It meant I had a lot to learn and there were people here who I could look to for inspiration. After this first practice, I was getting ready to leave, but was approached by the head sparring instructor, Master Isaac Fenta. I did not realize it at the time, but perhaps the most influential person on my taekwondo journey was Isaac. He asked me how I felt about the practice, and when I asked him what he thought I should focus on for the first few weeks he gave me detailed feedback. I had asked the question as more of a formality and did not actually expect the head instructor to have paid attention to what the new members were doing enough to give them feedback. The next week, I was still undecided about whether I wanted to put in the time commitment to be a part of this club, but Isaac reached out to me and asked if I was planning to come. It was in this moment that I realized the instructors of the club truly cared about each individual member, regardless of how long they had been there. I did not want to let down their faith in me, so I showed up to practice again. This time after practice, some of the club members came up to me and asked me how I felt. I had never met a club or community who had put in so much of an effort to make everyone feel welcomed and show that they care about each other. I realized this was a community I wanted to be a part of and eventually contribute to during my time at MIT.

The first two years of my MIT Taekwondo experience, I primarily focused on sparring and did not focus too much on poomsae. However, as I earned my double black stripe, I realized that the next step for me was to improve on my poomsae and retest for my black belt. While my sparring had improved significantly, my poomsae was now what was lacking. I spent the next year at MIT trying to improve in this area, so that I felt qualified in all aspects when I retested. 

This last year at MIT Taekwondo was perhaps the most involved I have been with the sport and the club. I started staying after practice to improve my forms and bond more with the members I would regularly practice with. I exercised more discipline and put pressure on myself to do better and be a role model to those who were just joining the club. However, with this greater investment, what had previously been a more casual extracurricular became something more serious and meaningful to me. And with this greater sense of importance, I started to feel scared. 

I was scared about my poomsae not being good enough. I was scared about not remembering all my one step and sparring step drills. I was scared of teaching lower belts because I did not feel qualified to be giving them feedback, and I felt that they deserved better instruction then I was able to offer. And this fear built up.

I started to become scared of not performing at the level I should be in even what I had considered to be my strengths. I had always been able to take a hit in sparring and deliver one right back, but I started to become scared of even initiating a kick and would instead wait and try to strategize a new way of performing instead of following my instincts. Every single thing I did now carried so much more intention, and I was scared of doing it wrong.

I think what eventually helped me overcome this fear was our group black belt training in the month before our test with Master Fenta. In the beginning of these trainings, I did make mistakes, and I was doing things wrong. But instead of letting me continue to do things incorrectly, Isaac made sure we knew the correct way to do it and made sure we practiced it the correct way. Training with my cohort, I realized that I was not the only one making mistakes, and it was also alright to make mistakes because making these mistakes is the only way you know how to fix them. Not only that, but training with people who were in a similar boat as me helped all of us grow, because we were all able to help each other without one of us feeling the pressure to know more or less than the person next to us.

My first major lesson in this training arrived in the form of a burn out drill on my birthday. I had just enjoyed a nice Indian dinner with some friends and as always when I'm given good Indian food, I definitely overate. Taekwondo practice right after may not have been the smartest move, but I was determined to push myself with this test coming up. Not going to practice was not an option to me because failing to attend would mean I was allowing myself to be lazy and justifying it with excuses. I knew that if I let it slide once, it would leave room for it to happen again and a core characterstic of a black belt to me was discipline. The first half of the practice was honestly alright, but it was the end of the practice when we started doing specific black belt training that I started to feel the effects of my dinner. Specifically, we were asked to perform side kicks down and back from the mat three times without letting our foot touch the ground. If our foot touched the ground, we would have to start over. Once we finished one leg, we would have to repeat with the other leg. The first lap was honestly alright and felt easy if anything. It was during the second lap that I started to feel my thighs burn. In the third lap I thought I was going to faint, throw up, or both. But I kept going because I knew that if I gave up on this lap, I would have to start all over again. There were so many times in that third lap I thought I would fall over or collapse. But I kept telling myself you have to finish. On the second half of my third lap I was feeling so lightheaded that I couldn't even think of anything else except focusing on my fellow trainee straight ahead and knowing that with each kick I got closer to her and closer to finishing the drill. My focus sharpened so much to make sure I was looking straight and didn't fall over that it felt almost meditative. I managed to block out the burning pain and exhaustion by fixating on a single point, and I almost felt as though I had be transported to another world.  Once I made it to the end I basically collapsed, but I learned something that day. The only thing stopping me, the thing that causes me to give up, is myself. If I'm are determined to not give up, I won't. I wouldn't become a black belt by giving up, but by pushing through and having that mental fortitude to keep going even when my body was complaining and telling me that I couldn't do it because the truth was if I pushed myself enough, I knew that I could.

As these trainings progressed, I became more comfortable in the areas I felt I was weaker in. Not only that, but I also realized that I actually performed better when I was more confident in myself. A glaring example of this is our board break. When we originally practiced, I was scared to even commit to the break with my kick, which automatically meant I would not break the board. During one practice, I kicked the red (second hardest) board at least 10 times and failed all of these times. Eventually, I slowed myself down, thought about the exact moves I needed to do, took a deep breath, and told myself this is it. I somehow managed to break the board that time. Isaac immediately followed with the black (hardest) board, which I had never used in my time at MIT. I followed the same process and broke it on the second try. To say I was shocked is an understatement, and I chalked it up to luck. We did some more curriculum work and came back to the board break at the end of practice. This time, we would only have 5 chances to break the black board. I followed the same preparation mentality as before and told myself that if I was confident that this was the kick I would break it, one of my 5 kicks should work. I was able to break it on the third try, and I realized this was no longer just luck.

It was then that I learned perhaps my most important lesson coming into the black belt test. If I perform something unconfidently wrong, it can be no better than if I perform it confidently wrong. Either way, it is still wrong, but at least it looks better in the second scenario. However, if I perform something confidently right, it is much better than if I perform it unconfidently right. In the case of the board break, it is the difference between breaking the board and not. And more often than not, I was right. I had trained extensively for this test, and the most important thing I needed to remind myself to do well was to have confidence in myself. I needed to have the confidence that I knew all of my curriculum to perform with the confidence required for the test. I needed to have confidence in my physical abilities to push through the burnout drills and believe that I was strong enough to do what was instructed. But most of all I needed to have confidence in my ability to be useful to other members of the club as an assistant instructor. I started giving feedback to other people when I saw them practicing on the side and I realized that what I said actually could be helpful to others. 

I approached my test today with confidence and grit to push myself, and I succeeded. I received my black belt for the second time, but this time it felt much more meaninful and real. While the belt itself was a nice physical reminder of what I had accomplished, my biggest success with this journey was the lessons I learned about both myself and what it means mentally to me to be a black belt. After my test ended, I reminisced on my journey and what got me here while I thanked my instructor Isaac for the irreplacable role he played in it. I had already expressed my gratitude towards him in my speech earlier in the test and how his simple question regarding whether or not I was coming back to practice was one of the main reasons I did because it showed me how much he valued and cared about all of the students in the club. He told me he had reflected on what I said and remembered that the reason he did is because after observing me in the first practice he realized that whenever I do something, I do it with my whole heart and he wanted someone like that to be in the club. I am not sure how he was able to observe that from just the first practice and honestly I had never thought about it in that way until then, but I realized that he was right. Whether it came to my friendships, my travels, or any of my other hobbies, when I truly commited to something, I commited with my whole heart and I did the best that I possibly could because I loved it. 

My journey with taekwondo has been one marked by such an incredible and welcoming community and I can only hope to give even a fraction of that love and knowledge I learned back. I hope I can continue to spread what I have learned throughout my journey with others in the future and am beyond grateful for the opportunity to engage with such a beautiful art form. I still have a lot of learning to do, but I am no longer scared of asking for help, and instead feel ready to embrace my mistakes and learn from them. There will always be fear where there is intention, but to me the mark of a black belt is to overcome these fears and to carry yourself with confidence.
